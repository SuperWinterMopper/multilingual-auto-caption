[0.00 - 5.52]  exactly that is that you that you cite is a point to be observed and
[5.52 - 11.76]  it was already monitored by the PLN let's remember there that they were there
[11.76 - 16.72]  in a strategy to make it to go to Bolsonaro to go there to try to there
[16.72 - 21.36]  is movement the militancy in 2025 understanding that if he was
[21.36 - 26.00]  prison this isolation could be of some form affect the plans of the
[26.00 - 30.00]  party for the elections of 2026 and then I call attention to
[30.00 - 33.28]  The first is, that shows that the PL,
[33.28 - 35.78]  in fact, it says there internally in the
[35.78 - 37.00]  back doors, which is, there is a
[37.00 - 41.68]  teto for the defense of the ex-president
[41.68 - 42.48]  A.R. Bolsonaro.
[42.48 - 44.92]  So, the candidates of 2026, they will
[44.92 - 47.18]  be to support us in Bolsonaroism,
[47.18 - 49.12]  in the ideas of Bolsonaroism.
[49.12 - 51.36]  But the defense of the ex-president
[51.36 - 54.12]  as a person goes to a certain
[54.12 - 55.92]  point, and then they will
[55.92 - 58.00]  calculate there, these candidates,
[58.00 - 59.96]  to which point would it be
[60.00 - 68.58]  or not,
[68.58 - 69.72]  for the same question,
[69.72 - 70.82]  I'm going to call out
[70.82 - 71.82]  the president of President
[71.82 - 72.82]  Yair Bolsonaro.
[72.82 - 74.06]  And I'll call attention to what
[74.06 - 75.00]  me said there
[75.00 - 76.22]  some integrants of the PL
[76.22 - 78.60]  about the post of Fulair Bolsonaro.
[78.60 - 79.82]  This figure is a figure that,
[79.82 - 82.02]  to be the herder political
[82.02 - 82.74]  of the father.
[82.74 - 84.42]  He has to be a little more
[84.42 - 84.60]  to do a little more,
[84.60 - 85.62]  to do this movement and this
[85.62 - 87.66]  work in the next months,
[87.66 - 89.98]  of being a more Jair Bolsonaro.
[90.00 - 96.00]  that, for example, that he open the doors of his cabinet to talk with the party
[96.00 - 102.00]  or allies there, the opposition, in regional, you know, the prefects there,
[102.00 - 108.00]  the municipies, for that it is more accessible to facilitate even this work
[108.00 - 114.00]  to transform him in this figure that will be, at least, we don't know if this will remain,
[114.00 - 120.00]  but it will be the pre-candidate, it will be the candidate, the heir of Bolsonaro,
[120.00 - 126.00]  So, there, there is a lot of work that needs to be made for that figure,
[126.00 - 132.00]  which is Flavio Bolsonaro, in front of the understanding of that it is necessary to protect that,
[132.00 - 134.00]  even this capital political of Bolsonaro.
[134.00 - 139.00]  So, we have come in this year of 2020, with a lot of things there to happen,
[139.00 - 141.00]  but elections have already started.
[141.00 - 146.20]  The articulations already started, and that has to do with the elections also.
