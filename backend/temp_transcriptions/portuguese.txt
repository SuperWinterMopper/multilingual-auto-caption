[0.00 - 6.36]  exactly that that you that you say is a point to be observed and that was
[6.36 - 12.84]  it was monitored by the PLN let's remember there that they were there in a strategy
[12.84 - 20.40]  to make it to Bolsonaro to go there to try to there movement the militancy in 2025
[20.40 - 24.60]  understanding that if he was prison this isolation could be of some form
[24.60 - 30.60]  of 2016 for 2016
[30.60 - 33.60]  2016. The first of all, that's a question of something that the PL,
[33.60 - 36.60]  even says there internally in the backdoor,
[36.60 - 38.60]  which is there is a
[38.60 - 41.60]  to the person of ex-president
[41.60 - 42.60]  A.R. Bolsonaro.
[42.60 - 45.60]  So the candidates of 2006, they will be
[45.60 - 48.60]  to support the Bolsonaro's ideas of Bolsonaro,
[48.60 - 51.60]  but the defense of the president,
[51.60 - 52.60]  as a person,
[52.60 - 54.60]  it goes to a certain point
[54.60 - 64.22]  And,
[64.22 - 67.10]  that, they will come out there,
[67.10 - 69.36]  they will be able to talk about that.
[69.36 - 70.60]  I will be of the ex-president,
[70.60 - 72.14]  the family of ex-president,
[72.14 - 73.14]  I think,
[73.14 - 74.60]  I will call attention to what I am
[74.60 - 76.60]  there, some of the integrants of PL,
[76.60 - 78.60]  about the posture of Flav Bolsonaro,
[78.60 - 79.78]  this figure here.
[79.78 - 80.98]  To be the her,
[80.98 - 82.76]  the political of the father,
[82.76 - 87.26]  to be a little more, to do this movement and this work in the next months,
[87.26 - 91.00]  of being more a little Jair Bolsonaro, right? They, for example,
[91.00 - 96.26]  there that he opens the doors of his cabinet to conversate with the party or
[96.26 - 102.56]  aliases there, the opposition in the regional, the prefects there,
[102.56 - 107.12]  the municipies, for that it is more accessible to facilitate
[107.12 - 114.12]  that, of already will be taken to serve as
[114.12 - 116.12]  the president of the pre-candidate,
[116.12 - 118.12]  it is already a pre-candidate,
[118.12 - 122.12]  and it will be the candidate of Bolsonaro for the urns in 2026.
[122.12 - 126.12]  So there is a lot of work that needs to be made for this figure,
[126.12 - 131.12]  which is Flavio Bolsonaro, in the understanding of that it is necessary to protect
[131.12 - 134.12]  even this political capital of Bolsonaro.
[134.12 - 137.10]  So we are in this year of 2026,
