0.00	6.00	Exactly that, this isolation that you mention, Jussara, is a point to be observed and it is already...
6.00	12.00	somehow monitored by the PL itself, right? Let's remember that they were there in...
12.00	18.00	strategy of doing until Bolsonaro traveled to try to move the thousand...
18.00	24.00	avoidance in the year 2025, understanding that if he were arrested, this isolation could mean something...
24.00	30.00	way to affect the party's plans for the 2026 elections. And here I draw your attention...
30.00	36.00	to two points. The first is this, the research showing something that the PL already says internally, downloading us...
36.00	42.00	That is, there is a ceiling for the defense of the person of former president Airbus.
42.00	48.00	Bolsonaro. So the 2026 candidates will rely on Bolsonarism, on ideas.
48.00	54.00	of Bolsonarism, but the defense of the former president, as a person, goes to a certain extent...
54.00	60.00	point and then they will calculate these candidates to what point would be well
60.00	66.00	or not for the candidates themselves to defend the former president, which could be very restricted there.
66.00	72.00	From the middle of this year that has just begun, to the ex-president's children, the ex-president's family.
72.00	78.00	and I'm going to draw attention to what some members of the PL told me there about Flávio Bolsonaro's stance
78.00	84.00	In this figure here, to be his father's political heir, he has to get a little closer.
84.00	90.00	more, to do this movement and this work in the coming months, to be a little more Air Bolsonaro, right?
90.00	96.00	They demand, for example, that he opens the doors of his office to talk to the party member.
96.00	102.00	or opposition allies in regional directorates, the mayors.
102.00	108.00	municipalities, so that it is more accessible to facilitate this work.
108.00	114.00	to transform him into this figure that he will be at least until now, we don't know if...
114.00	120.00	This will remain, but he will be the pre-candidate, he is already the pre-candidate, he will be the candidate Heir to Bolsonaro.
120.00	126.00	to the polls in 2026, so there is a lot of work that needs to be done for this figure.
126.00	132.00	which is Flávio Bolsonaro, given the understanding that it is necessary to protect, including.
132.00	138.00	this political capital of Bolsonaro. In other words, we arrived in 2020. Six with a lot of things there.
138.00	144.00	to happen, but elections have already started, the articulations have already started and that has to do with it.
144.00	146.20	with the 2026 elections too.
