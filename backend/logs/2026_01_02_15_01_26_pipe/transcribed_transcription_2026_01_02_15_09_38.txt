1.10	4.10	How to recognize those who want to always have
4.10	4.40	you.
4.90	7.60	and with which it is frankly unusual to discuss
7.70	10.60	because you will never be able to hear your point of view.
11.10	12.10	For them to be recognized,
12.30	13.10	It's easy.
13.50	14.60	they say,
15.30	15.90	with you.
16.10	17.10	when you talk about
17.40	18.80	There is always a yes, but
18.90	19.90	in reserve.
20.10	22.50	for so to contradict what you say
22.80	24.90	or add a precision
25.20	26.80	that finally,
27.20	28.20	They know you.
29.50	30.40	For example,
31.00	32.70	This night, the sky is green.
32.80	34.00	It will surely be.
34.40	36.50	Yes, but it can also be
37.40	38.50	Another example?
38.90	41.40	Good night.  I like to wear a white shirt.
41.90	44.10	Yes, but it's too classic.
45.10	46.30	You know what I mean?
46.90	47.70	me.
48.40	50.10	Don't try to have a reason.
50.30	50.80	of you.
51.00	51.80	Thank you.
52.60	54.20	and then...
54.60	57.30	Because in reality, they just need to be recognized
57.40	58.20	for who they are.
59.20	61.50	And finally, as he said,
62.20	63.80	you.
64.10	64.80	or be happy.
65.80	67.60	Well, it was a good video, finally
68.40	71.10	Yes, but it could have been more rapid.
