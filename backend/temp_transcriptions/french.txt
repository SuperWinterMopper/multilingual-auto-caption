[0.00 - 4.00]  How to recognize those and those who want to always have reason
[4.00 - 7.00]  and with which it is frankly, it is not useful to discuss,
[7.00 - 10.00]  because you will never hear your point of view.
[11.00 - 13.00]  For them, it is easy.
[13.00 - 15.00]  They say yes, but
[15.00 - 17.00]  with them, when you talk about it,
[17.00 - 20.00]  there is often a yes but in reserve
[20.00 - 22.00]  for, or to contradict what you say
[22.00 - 25.00]  or add a precision
[25.00 - 27.00]  which shows that, finally,
[27.00 - 29.00]  they know better than you.
[30.00 - 34.00]  This is, I'm on.
[34.00 - 36.00]  Yes, but it is not to be able to see.
[36.00 - 37.94]  Yes, but it can also be
[37.94 - 38.94]  Yes.
[38.94 - 41.94]  Another example, I like to wear a white shirt.
[41.94 - 45.18]  Yes, but it's too classic.
[45.18 - 46.98]  You know what I want to say.
[46.98 - 51.06]  My advice, don't try not to have reason with them.
[51.06 - 52.76]  It's pain to be.
[52.76 - 54.00]  And then,
[54.00 - 55.90]  Rassurely, because they are just
[55.90 - 59.06]  need to be recognized for who they are.
[59.06 - 59.98]  And finally,
[60.00 - 70.00]  As,
[70.00 - 72.00]  more rapid
